# Ethnic_Bias_in_COVID
This project is investigating the use of word embeddings to identify any ethnic bias with COVID-19 related articles.

## Goals
This exploration includes investigating the associated bias for Asians in comparison to White ethnicities. This analysis is broken into the following sections:
1. Association with COVID-19 terms
2. Assocation with Hate Crimes
3. Association with Outsider Adjectives
4. Sentiment of Most Associated Adjectives

## Data 
The data was collected using AYLIEN's COVID News dataset. 
Data is presented in JSONL file format with one line per story object.

Word lists were collected through a compilation of news articles and papers for COVID-19 and Hate Crime terms. Outsider adjectives and the larger list of general adjectives were used from the SI of _Word Embeddings Quantify 100 Years of Gender and Ethnic Stereotypes_.
